# How to Use headus UVLayout v2 for Creating and Editing UV Texture Coordinates
  
UV texture coordinates are essential for mapping 2D images onto 3D models. They determine how the texture wraps around the surface of the model and how it reacts to lighting and shading. However, creating and editing UVs can be a tedious and time-consuming process, especially for complex models with many polygons and details.

That's why many 3D artists use headus UVLayout v2, a stand-alone application that simplifies and speeds up the UV creation and editing workflow. headus UVLayout v2 is used by professionals in the games and visual effects industries, by hobbyists of all types and by students. It offers a unique approach that gives texture artists the tools they need to produce high quality low distortion UVs in significantly less time than they would by traditional methods[^1^].
  
## What are the features of headus UVLayout v2?
  
headus UVLayout v2 has three modes: Demo, Hobbyist/Student and Professional. The Demo mode is free, but has a limited duration license and only the very basic tools are available. The Hobbyist/Student mode has all the tools for creating and editing UVs for non-commercial use, but you need to purchase a license to use it. The Professional mode has all the tools plus some advanced features for optimizing UVs for high-end production, but you also need to purchase a license to use it[^2^].
  
Some of the features of headus UVLayout v2 are:
  
- A user-friendly interface with intuitive buttons and hot-keys.
- A real-time 3D view of the model and the UVs.
- A fast and accurate flattening algorithm that minimizes stretching and distortion.
- A powerful packing algorithm that maximizes the use of texture space.
- A variety of tools for cutting, welding, pinning, scaling, rotating, flipping, aligning, stacking and coloring UV shells.
- A symmetry option that mirrors UVs across an axis.
- A relax option that smooths out UVs based on edge angles.
- A box option that creates cubic UVs for box-like models.
- A lock option that locks overlapping shells together during packing.
- An auto-fit option that adjusts UVs to fit within a specified texture size.
- An export option that saves UVs as OBJ or UVL files.

## How to use headus UVLayout v2?
  
The basic workflow of using headus UVLayout v2 is as follows:

1. Import your 3D model as an OBJ file.
2. Cut your model into UV shells using the Cut tool or the Auto Cut option.
3. Flatten your shells using the Flatten tool or the Auto Flatten option.
4. Edit your shells using the various tools available.
5. Pack your shells using the Pack tool or the Auto Pack option.
6. Export your UVs as an OBJ or UVL file.

For more details on how to use headus UVLayout v2, you can watch the training videos on their website[^1^] or read their user guide[^2^]. You can also download a free demo version from their website[^2^] and try it for yourself.
  
## Conclusion
  
headus UVLayout v2 is a powerful and efficient application for creating and editing UV texture coordinates for 3D models. It can save you a lot of time and effort in your texturing workflow and help you achieve better results. Whether you are a professional or a hobbyist, headus UVLayout v2 can be a valuable tool for your 3D projects.
