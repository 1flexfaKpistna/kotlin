Some critics also found the film misogynistic and exploitative, while others appreciated its honesty and courage. The film has a rating of 5.5 out of 10 on IMDb[^2^] and 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.

The film can be seen as a reflection of the social and cultural changes that occurred in Spain after the end of Franco's dictatorship and the emergence of democracy. The film explores themes such as sexual freedom, identity, gender, desire, power and violence. The film also challenges the traditional norms and values of Spanish society, especially regarding the role and representation of women. Lulu is a complex and contradictory character, who is both a victim and an agent of her own sexuality. She is constantly searching for new experiences and sensations, but also suffers from loneliness and insecurity. She is trapped in a cycle of addiction and self-destruction, but also finds moments of joy and liberation.
 
The film also showcases the talent and charisma of two of Spain's most famous actors, Francesca Neri and Javier Bardem. Neri delivers a fearless and intense performance as Lulu, showing a wide range of emotions and expressions. She is able to convey both the innocence and the corruption of her character, as well as her vulnerability and strength. Bardem, in one of his earliest roles, plays Jimmy, a sadistic and charismatic gay man who becomes Lulu's tormentor and lover. He displays his natural charm and charisma, as well as his ability to play dark and complex characters.
 
The film is a provocative and controversial work of art, that does not shy away from showing the raw and graphic aspects of human sexuality. It is also a compelling and tragic story of a woman's quest for fulfillment and identity in a changing and challenging world. The film is not for the faint-hearted or the easily offended, but for those who appreciate bold and daring cinema.
